## Assembly Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Bottom Skirt

Start the four M2.5 x 12mm screws into the bottom skirt (part 3). Thread them in just a few turns—enough to hold, but leave plenty of depth for later steps.

### Step 2: Build the Base Assembly

1. Place the **magnetic puck** inside the **base** (part 1)
2. Set the **battery spacer** (part 2) on top of the puck

---

### Step 3: Insert Base Assembly into Bottom Skirt

Place the base assembly (from Step 2) inside the **bottom skirt** (part 3).

### Step 4: Install Bottom-Center Plate

Place the **bottom-center plate** (part 4) on top of the base assembly. Drive the four screws in a little further to hold the plate in position—do not fully tighten yet.

### Step 5: Add the Stack

Place the **stack** (part 5) on top of the bottom-center plate.

---

### Step 6: Install Wire Harness

Install the completed wire harness:

1. Fit the **battery terminals** over the ends of the battery box (built into the stack)
2. Seat the **switch** into its pocket in the bottom-center plate
3. Seat the **charging board** into its pocket in the bottom-center plate

> ⚠️ **Note:** The wire harness must be assembled separately before this step. See the [Wire Harness Guide](ILLO_Wire_Harness_Guide.md).

---

### Step 7: Install Top-Center Plate

Place the **top-center plate** (part 6) on top of the assembly. The plate is keyed and will only fit in the correct orientation.

Drive the four M2.5 x 12mm screws in a little further to secure the top-center plate. Do not fully tighten yet.

### Step 8: Install Battery

Insert the 3.7V LiPo battery into the battery box.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Verify correct polarity! Match the **+** and **-** markings on the battery to the terminals.

---

### Step 9: Mount Circuit Playground Bluefruit

1. Position the Circuit Playground Bluefruit on top of the stack
2. Orient the board so the **battery connector** (JST port) is above the **negative battery terminal**
3. Secure with two M2.5 x 5mm screws through the **GND** and **3.3V** holes

> ⚠️ **Do not overtighten!** The board can crack if screws are driven too hard.

---

### Step 10: Connect Battery

Plug the **JST PH 2-Pin cable** from the wire harness into the battery connector on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit.

---

### Step 11: Install Upper Skirt

Fit the **upper skirt** (part 7) onto the assembly, aligning it with the bottom skirt.

Finish driving in the four M2.5 x 12mm screws to secure both skirts and all internal plates together.

---

### Step 12: Attach Dome

Place the **dome** (part 8) on top of the upper skirt. Twist it left or right approximately ½ inch to lock it in place.

## Final Checks

- [ ] All four screws are secure (not overtightened)
- [ ] Battery is seated correctly with proper polarity
- [ ] JST cable is fully plugged in
- [ ] Switch and charging board are accessible through their ports
- [ ] Dome is locked in place

---

## Next Steps

Your ILLO UFO is now assembled! Continue with:

1. **[Quick Start Guide](ILLO_Quick_Start_Guide.md)** — Power on and verify operation
2. **[Device Configuration Guide](ILLO_Device_Configuration_Guide.md)** — Customize modes and settings

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| UFO won't power on | Battery not connected | Check JST cable connection |
| UFO won't power on | Battery depleted | Charge via USB-C port |
| UFO won't power on | Incorrect battery polarity | Remove and reinstall battery correctly |
| Screws won't drive in | Cross-threaded | Back out and restart carefully |
| Dome won't lock | Misaligned | Lift and reseat, then twist |
| Won't levitate | Too heavy | Check that no extra parts are inside |
| Won't levitate | Puck misaligned | Ensure magnetic puck is centered in base |
